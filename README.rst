What is this?
-------------

Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications, supporting Python 3.5+.
It includes modules for many different purposes, including the following:

- ``twisted.web``: HTTP clients and servers, HTML templating, and a WSGI server
- ``twisted.conch``: SSHv2 and Telnet clients and servers and terminal emulators
- ``twisted.words``: Clients and servers for IRC, XMPP, and other IM protocols
- ``twisted.mail``: IMAPv4, POP3, SMTP clients and servers
- ``twisted.positioning``: Tools for communicating with NMEA-compatible GPS receivers
- ``twisted.names``: DNS client and tools for making your own DNS servers
- ``twisted.trial``: A unit testing framework that integrates well with Twisted-based code.

Twisted supports all major system event loops -- ``select`` (all platforms), ``poll`` (most POSIX platforms), ``epoll`` (Linux), ``kqueue`` (FreeBSD, macOS), IOCP (Windows), and various GUI event loops (GTK+2/3, Qt, wxWidgets).
Third-party reactors can plug into Twisted, and provide support for additional event loops.


Installing
----------

To install the latest version of Twisted using pip::

  $ pip install twisted

Additional instructions for installing this software are in `the installation instructions <INSTALL.rst>`_.


Documentation and Support
-------------------------

Twisted's documentation is available from the `Twisted Matrix website <https://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/>`_.
This documentation contains how-tos, code examples, and an API reference.

Help is also available on the `Twisted mailing list <https://twistedmatrix.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/twisted-python>`_.

There is also a pair of very lively IRC channels, ``#twisted`` (for general Twisted questions) and ``#twisted.web`` (for Twisted Web), on ``chat.freenode.net``.


Unit Tests
----------

Twisted has a comprehensive test suite, which can be run by ``tox``::

  $ tox -l                       # to view all test environments
  $ tox -e nocov                 # to run all the tests without coverage
  $ tox -e withcov               # to run all the tests with coverage
  $ tox -e alldeps-withcov-posix # install all dependencies, run tests with coverage on POSIX platform


You can test running the test suite under the different reactors with the ``TWISTED_REACTOR`` environment variable::

  $ env TWISTED_REACTOR=epoll tox -e alldeps-withcov-posix

Some of these tests may fail if you:

* don't have the dependencies required for a particular subsystem installed,
* have a firewall blocking some ports (or things like Multicast, which Linux NAT has shown itself to do), or
* run them as root.


Static Code checkers
--------------------

You can ensure that code complies to Twisted coding standards::

  $ tox -e lint   # run pyflakes and pycodestyle to check code against coding standards
  $ tox -e mypy   # run mypy static type checker to check for type errors
