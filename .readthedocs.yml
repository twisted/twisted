  # This should not fail on errors so that we can view the rendered Read The Docs
  # pages even on errors.
  # We have a separate build process which fails on errors and shows all
  # the errors in one go.
  # This can be re-enable once RTD is updated with https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues/7116
  fail_on_warning: False

# We don't proofread all the output formats, and we don't know if anyone really
# uses some of them.  Is anyone actually printing the docs out as a PDF?  If a
# particular format is useful to someone let's let them download it.  If
# dubiously-used formats start causing build errors that are difficult to debug
# (i.e. PDF, EPub) feel free to disable them if necessary, but HTMLZip is an
# offline archive of the actual docs website that everyone uses most frequently
# and should be kept working; if it's breaking then probably something is wrong
# with the website as well.
