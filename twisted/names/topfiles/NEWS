Other
-----
 - #7728


Twisted Names 15.0.0 (2015-01-24)

=================================

No significant changes have been made for this release.


Twisted Names 14.0.0 (2014-05-08)
=================================

Features
--------
 - twisted.names.root.Resolver now accepts a resolverFactory argument,
   which makes it possible to control how root.Resolver performs
   iterative queries to authoritative nameservers. (#6095)
 - twisted.names.dns.Message now has a repr method which shows only
   those instance flags, fields and sections which are set to non-
   default values. (#6847)
 - twisted.names.dns.Message now support rich comparison. (#6848)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.names.server.DNSServerFactory now responds with messages
   whose flags and fields are reset to their default values instead of
   copying these from the request. This means that AD and CD flags,
   and EDNS OPT records in the request are no longer mirrored back to
   the client. (#6645)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - twisted.names now has narrative documentation showing how to create
   a custom DNS server. (#6864)
 - twisted.names.server now has full API documentation. (#6886)
 - twisted.names now has narrative documentation explaining how to use
   its client APIs. (#6925)
 - twisted.names now has narrative documentation and examples showing
   how to perform reverse DNS lookups. (#6969)

=================================

Features

   knows about for inclusion in the additional section of a response
   (following the same logic previously used for including A records
   there). (#6642)
 - twisted.names.dns.Message now allows encoding and decoding of the
   Authentic Data (AD) and Checking Disabled (CD) flags described in
   RFC2535. (#6680)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.names.resolve.ResolverChain now returns a
   twisted.names.error.DomainError failure if its resolvers list is
   empty. (#5992)
 - twisted.names.authority.FileAuthority now only returns
   AuthoritativeDomainError (NXDOMAIN) for names which are subdomains.
   (#6475)
 - The Deferred returned by twisted.names.client.Resolver.queryTCP now
   fires with an error if the TCP connection attempt fails. (#6658)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.names.dns.DNSProtocol instances no longer throw an
   exception when disconnecting. (#5471)
 - twisted.names.tap.makeService (thus also "twistd dns") now makes a
   DNS server which gives precedence to the hosts file from its
   configuration over the remote DNS servers from its configuration.
   (#5524)
 - twisted.name.cache.CacheResolver now makes sure TTLs on returned
   results are never negative. (#5579)

   lookupAddress method now filters them out and its lookupIPV6Address
   method is now implemented. (#5098)
