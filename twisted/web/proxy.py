"""
Simplistic HTTP proxy support.

This comes in two main variants - the Proxy and the ReverseProxy.

When a Proxy is in use, a browser trying to connect to a server (say,
www.yahoo.com) will be intercepted by the Proxy, and the proxy will covertly
connect to the server, and return the result.

When a ReverseProxy is in use, the client connects directly to the ReverseProxy
(say, www.yahoo.com) which farms off the request to one of a pool of servers,
and returns the result.

Normally, a Proxy is used on the client end of an Internet connection, while a
ReverseProxy is used on the server end.
