Twisted Web 14.0.2 (2014-09-18)
===============================

No significant changes have been made for this release.


Twisted Web 14.0.1 (2014-09-17)
===============================

Bugfixes
--------
 - BrowserLikePolicyForHTTPS would always ignore the specified
   trustRoot and use the system trust root instead, which has been
   rectified. (#7647)


Twisted Web 14.0.0 (2014-05-08)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.http.proxiedLogFormatter can now be used with
   twisted.web.http.HTTPFactory (and subclasses) to record X
   -Forwarded-For values to the access log when the HTTP server is
   deployed behind a reverse proxy. (#1468)
 - twisted.web.client.Agent now uses
   twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions for SSL/TLS and benefits
   from its continuous improvements. (#6893)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.client.Agent now correctly manage flow-control on
   pooled connections, and therefore requests will no longer hang
   sometimes when deliverBody is not called synchronously within the
   callback on Request. (#6751)
 - twisted.web.client.Agent now verifies that the provided server
   certificate in a TLS connection is trusted by the platform. (#7042)
 - When requesting an HTTPS URL with twisted.web.client.Agent, the
   hostname of the presented certificate will be checked against the
   requested hostname; mismatches will now result in an error rather
   than a man-in-the-middle opportunity for attackers.  This may break
   existing code that incorrectly depended on insecure behavior, but
   such code was erroneous and should be updated.  (#4888)

Other
-----
 - #5004, #6881, #6956


Twisted Web 13.2.0 (2013-10-29)
===============================

Features
--------
 - IAgent has been added to twisted.web.iweb to explicitly define the
   interface implemented by the various "Agent" classes in
   twisted.web.client. (#6702)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.client.Response.deliverBody now calls connectionLost on
   the body protocol for responses with no body (such as 204, 304, and
   HEAD requests). (#5476)
 - twisted.web.static.loadMimeTypes now uses all available system MIME
   types. (#5717)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - Two attributes of twisted.web.iweb.IRequest, headers and
   received_headers, are now deprecated. (#6704)

Other
-----
 - #5387, #6119, #6121, #6695, #6701, #6734


Twisted Web 13.1.0 (2013-06-23)
===============================

Features
--------
 - The deferred returned by twisted.web.client.Agent.request can now
   be cancelled. (#4330)
 - twisted.web.client.BrowserLikeRedirectAgent, a new redirect agent,
   treats HTTP 301 and 302 like HTTP 303 on non-HEAD/GET requests,
   changing the method to GET before proceeding. (#5434)
 - The new attribute twisted.web.iweb.IResponse.request is a reference
   to a provider of the new twisted.web.iweb.IClientRequest interface
   which, among other things, provides a way to access the request's
   absolute URI. It is now also possible to inspect redirect history
   with twisted.web.iweb.IResponse.previousResponse. (#5435)
 - twisted.web.client.RedirectAgent now supports relative URI
   references in the Location HTTP header. (#5462)
 - twisted.web.client now provides readBody to collect the body of a
   response from Agent into a string. (#6251)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.QueryProtocol now generates valid Authorization
   headers for long user names and passwords. (#2980)

   including Tag instances serialized within attribute values. (#6275)

Other
-----
 - #6167, #6297, #6326


Twisted Web 12.3.0 (2012-12-20)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.server.Site now supports an encoders argument to encode
   request content, twisted.web.server.GzipEncoderFactory being the
   first one provided. (#104)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel.headerReceived now catches the error
   if the Content-Length header is not an integer and return a 400 Bad
   Request response. (#6029)
 - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel now drops the connection and issues a
   400 error upon receipt of a chunk-encoding encoded request with a
   bad chunk-length field. (#6030)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - twisted.web.iweb.IRequest now documents its `content` attribute and
   a new "web in 60 seconds" howto demonstrates its use. (#6181)

Other
-----
 - #5882, #5883, #5887, #5920, #6031, #6077, #6078, #6079, #6080,

===============================

Features
--------

   connections. (#3420)
 - Added twisted.web.template.renderElement, a function which renders
   an Element to a response. (#5395)
 - twisted.web.client.HTTPConnectionPool now ensures that failed
   queries on persistent connections are retried, when possible.
   (#5479)
 - twisted.web.template.XMLFile now supports FilePath objects. (#5509)
 - twisted.web.template.renderElement takes a doctype keyword
   argument, which will be written as the first line of the response,
   defaulting to the HTML5 doctype. (#5560)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.util.formatFailure now quotes all data in its output to
   avoid it being mistakenly interpreted as markup. (#4896)
 - twisted.web.distrib now lets distributed servers set the response
   message. (#5525)

 - #5404, #5438


Twisted Web 11.1.0 (2011-11-15)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.client.ProxyAgent is a new HTTP/1.1 web client which
   adds proxy support. (#1774)
 - twisted.web.client.Agent now takes optional connectTimeout and

 - The new class twisted.web.client.FileBodyProducer makes it easy to
   upload data in HTTP requests made using the Agent client APIs.
   (#4017)
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.XMLRPC now allows its lookupProcedure method to

   result Deferred after the underlying connection they use has been
   closed. (#3796)
 - twisted.web.server now omits the default Content-Type header from
   NOT MODIFIED responses. (#4156)
 - twisted.web.server now responds correctly to 'Expect: 100-continue'
   headers, although this is not yet usefully exposed to user code.
   (#4673)
 - twisted.web.client.Agent no longer raises an exception if a server
   responds and closes the connection before the request has been
   fully transmitted. (#5013)

-------------------------
 - twisted.web.google is now deprecated. (#5209)

Other
-----
 - #4951, #5057, #5175, #5288, #5316


Twisted Web 11.0.0 (2011-04-01)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web._newclient.HTTPParser (and therefore Agent) now handles
   HTTP headers delimited by bare LF newlines. (#3833)
 - twisted.web.client.downloadPage now accepts the `afterFoundGet`
   parameter, with the same meaning as the `getPage` parameter of the
   same name. (#4364)
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.Proxy constructor now takes additional 'timeout'
   and 'reactor' arguments. The 'timeout' argument defaults to 30
   seconds. (#4741)
 - Twisted Web now has a templating system, twisted.web.template,
   which is a direct, simplified derivative of Divmod Nevow. (#4939)

Bugfixes
--------
 - HTTPPageGetter now adds the port to the host header if it is not
   the default for that scheme. (#3857)
 - twisted.web.http.Request.write now raises an exception if it is
   called after response generation has already finished. (#4317)

 - twisted.web will now properly specify an encoding (UTF-8) on error,
   redirect, and directory listing pages, so that IE7 and previous
   will not improperly guess the 'utf7' encoding in these cases.
   Please note that Twisted still sets a *default* content-type of
   'text/html', and you shouldn't rely on that: you should set the
   encoding appropriately in your application. (#4900)
 - twisted.web.http.Request.setHost now sets the port in the host
   header if it is not the default. (#4918)
 - default NOT_IMPLEMENTED and NOT_ALLOWED pages now quote the request
   method and URI respectively, to protect against browsers which
   don't quote those values for us. (#4978)

 - Some broken links were fixed, descriptions were updated, and new
   API links were added in the Resource Templating documentation
   (resource-templates.xhtml) (#4968)

===============================

Features
--------

   using withRequest to cause them to be passed the HTTP request
   object. (#3073)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.QueryProtocol.handleResponse now disconnects
   from the server, meaning that Twisted XML-RPC clients disconnect
   from the server as soon as they receive a response, rather than
   relying on the server to disconnect. (#2518)
 - twisted.web.twcgi now generates responses containing all
   occurrences of duplicate headers produced by CGI scripts, not just
   the last value. (#4742)

Deprecations and Removals

   with an error. (#4411)
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.XMLRPC will now no longer trigger a RuntimeError
   by trying to write responses to closed connections. (#4423)

 - Fix broken links to deliverBody and iweb.UNKNOWN_LENGTH in
   doc/web/howto/client.xhtml. (#4507)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.web.twcgi.PHP3Script and twisted.web.twcgi.PHPScript are
   now deprecated. (#516)

Other
-----

   contained examples on a range of common web topics, is now a part
   of the Twisted Web howto documentation. (#4192)

Bugfixes
--------
 - Data and File from twisted.web.static and
   twisted.web.distrib.UserDirectory will now only generate a 200
   response for GET or HEAD requests.
   twisted.web.client.HTTPPageGetter will no longer ignore the case of

   Banana error when writing more than 640kB at once to the request
   object. (#3212)

 - The Error, PageRedirect, and InfiniteRedirection exception in
   twisted.web now initialize an empty message parameter by mapping
   the HTTP status code parameter to a descriptive string. Previously
   the lookup would always fail, leaving message empty.  (#3806)

 - The 'wsgi.input' WSGI environment object now supports -1 and None
   as arguments to the read and readlines methods. (#4114)

 - twisted.web.wsgi doesn't unquote QUERY_STRING anymore, thus
   complying with the WSGI reference implementation. (#4143)

 - The HTTP proxy will no longer pass on keep-alive request headers
   from the client, preventing pages from loading then "hanging"
   (leaving the connection open with no hope of termination). (#4179)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - Remove '--static' option from twistd web, that served as an alias
   for the '--path' option. (#3907)

 - The HTTP auth support in the web server now allows anonymous sessions by
   logging in with ANONYMOUS credentials when no Authorization header is
   provided in a request (#3924, #3936)
 - HTTPClientFactory now accepts a parameter to enable a common deviation from
   the HTTP 1.1 standard by responding to redirects in a POSTed request with a
   GET instead of another POST (#3624)
 - A new basic HTTP/1.1 client API is included in twisted.web.client.Agent
   (#886, #3987)

Fixes
-----
 - Requests for "insecure" children of a static.File (such as paths containing
   encoded directory separators) will now result in a 404 instead of a 500
   (#3549, #3469)
 - When specifying a followRedirect argument to the getPage function, the state
   of redirect-following for other getPage calls should now be unaffected.  It
   was previously overwriting a class attribute which would affect outstanding
   getPage calls (#3192)
 - Downloading an URL of the form "http://example.com:/" will now work,
   ignoring the extraneous colon (#2402)

   microdom's methods in general should now issue more meaningful exceptions
   when invalid parameters are passed (#3421)

   their responses by the twisted.web server. In addition, WSGI applications
   will no longer be able to specify the server-restricted headers Server and

   of returning a 500 error (#3601)
 - Certain request-bound memory and file resources are cleaned up slightly
   sooner by the request when the connection is lost (#1621, #3176)
 - xmlrpclib.DateTime objects should now correctly round-trip over twisted.web's
   XMLRPC support in all supported versions of Python, and errors during error
   serialization will no longer hang a twisted.web XMLRPC response (#2446)
 - request.content should now always be seeked to the beginning when
   request.process is called, so application code should never need to seek 
   back manually (#3585)
 - Fetching a child of static.File with a double-slash in the URL (such as
   "example//foo.html") should now return a 404 instead of a traceback and
   500 error (#3631)
 - downloadPage will now fire a Failure on its returned Deferred instead of
   indicating success when the connection is prematurely lost (#3645)
 - static.File will now provide a 404 instead of a 500 error when it was
   constructed with a non-existent file (#3634)
 - microdom should now serialize namespaces correctly (#3672)
 - The HTTP Auth support resource wrapper should no longer corrupt requests and
   cause them to skip a segment in the request path (#3679)
 - The twisted.web WSGI support should now include leading slashes in PATH_INFO,
   and SCRIPT_NAME will be empty if the application is at the root of the
   resource tree. This means that WSGI applications should no longer generate
   URLs with double-slashes in them even if they naively concatenate the values
   (#3721)
 - WSGI applications should now receive the requesting client's IP in the
   REMOTE_ADDR environment variable (#3730)

   refactoring of twisted.web's header support (#3697)
 - static.File now supports multiple ranges specified in the Range header
   (#3574)
 - static.File should now generate a correct Content-Length value when the
   requested Range value doesn't fit entirely within the file's contents (#3814)
 - Attempting to call request.finish() after the connection has been lost will
   now immediately raise a RuntimeError (#4013)
 - An HTTP-auth resource should now be able to directly render the wrapped
   avatar, whereas before it would only allow retrieval of child resources
   (#4014)
 - twisted.web's wsgi support should no longer attempt to call request.finish
   twice, which would cause errors in certain cases (#4025)
 - WSGI applications should now be able to handle requests with large bodies
   (#4029)
 - Exceptions raised from WSGI applications should now more reliably be turned
   into 500 errors on the HTTP level (#4019)
 - DeferredResource now correctly passes through exceptions raised from the
   wrapped resource, instead of turning them all into 500 errors (#3932)
 - Agent.request now generates a Host header when no headers are passed at
   (#4131)
