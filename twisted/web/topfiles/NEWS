   since 12.1 that have now been removed. (#7828)

Other
-----
 - #6927, #7797, #7802, #7846


Twisted Web 15.1.0 (2015-04-02)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.static.File allows defining a custom resource for
   rendering forbidden pages. (#6951)

Other
-----
 - #7000, #7485, #7750, #7762


Twisted Web 15.0.0 (2015-01-24)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.client.Agent.usingEndpointFactory allows creating an
   Agent that connects in non-standard ways, e.g. via a proxy or a
   UNIX socket. (#6634)
 - The Deferred returned by twisted.web.client.readBody can now be
   cancelled. (#6686)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.web.iweb.IRequest.getClient is now deprecated.  Its
   implementation in Twisted, twisted.web.http.Request.getClient, is
   also deprecated and will no longer attempt to resolve the client IP
   address to a hostname. (#2252)

Other
-----
 - #7247, #7302, #7680, #7689


Twisted Web 14.0.2 (2014-09-18)
===============================

No significant changes have been made for this release.


Twisted Web 14.0.1 (2014-09-17)
===============================

Bugfixes
--------
 - BrowserLikePolicyForHTTPS would always ignore the specified
   trustRoot and use the system trust root instead, which has been
   rectified. (#7647)


Twisted Web 14.0.0 (2014-05-08)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.http.proxiedLogFormatter can now be used with
   twisted.web.http.HTTPFactory (and subclasses) to record X
   -Forwarded-For values to the access log when the HTTP server is
   deployed behind a reverse proxy. (#1468)
 - twisted.web.client.Agent now uses
   twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions for SSL/TLS and benefits
   from its continuous improvements. (#6893)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.client.Agent now correctly manage flow-control on
   pooled connections, and therefore requests will no longer hang
   sometimes when deliverBody is not called synchronously within the
   callback on Request. (#6751)
 - twisted.web.client.Agent now verifies that the provided server
   certificate in a TLS connection is trusted by the platform. (#7042)
 - When requesting an HTTPS URL with twisted.web.client.Agent, the
   hostname of the presented certificate will be checked against the
   requested hostname; mismatches will now result in an error rather
   than a man-in-the-middle opportunity for attackers.  This may break
   existing code that incorrectly depended on insecure behavior, but
   such code was erroneous and should be updated.  (#4888)

Other
-----
 - #5004, #6881, #6956


Twisted Web 13.2.0 (2013-10-29)
===============================

Twisted Web 13.1.0 (2013-06-23)
===============================

Features
--------
 - The deferred returned by twisted.web.client.Agent.request can now
   be cancelled. (#4330)
 - twisted.web.client.BrowserLikeRedirectAgent, a new redirect agent,
   treats HTTP 301 and 302 like HTTP 303 on non-HEAD/GET requests,
   changing the method to GET before proceeding. (#5434)
 - The new attribute twisted.web.iweb.IResponse.request is a reference
   to a provider of the new twisted.web.iweb.IClientRequest interface
   which, among other things, provides a way to access the request's
   absolute URI. It is now also possible to inspect redirect history
   with twisted.web.iweb.IResponse.previousResponse. (#5435)
 - twisted.web.client.RedirectAgent now supports relative URI
   references in the Location HTTP header. (#5462)
 - twisted.web.client now provides readBody to collect the body of a
   response from Agent into a string. (#6251)

   request content, twisted.web.server.GzipEncoderFactory being the
   first one provided. (#104)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel.headerReceived now catches the error
   if the Content-Length header is not an integer and return a 400 Bad
   Request response. (#6029)
 - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel now drops the connection and issues a
   400 error upon receipt of a chunk-encoding encoded request with a
   bad chunk-length field. (#6030)

Improved Documentation

===============================

Features
--------

   queries on persistent connections are retried, when possible.
   (#5479)
 - twisted.web.template.XMLFile now supports FilePath objects. (#5509)
 - twisted.web.template.renderElement takes a doctype keyword
   argument, which will be written as the first line of the response,

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.util.formatFailure now quotes all data in its output to
   avoid it being mistakenly interpreted as markup. (#4896)

   closed. (#3796)
 - twisted.web.server now omits the default Content-Type header from

-------------------------
 - twisted.web.google is now deprecated. (#5209)

Other
-----
 - #4951, #5057, #5175, #5288, #5316


Twisted Web 11.0.0 (2011-04-01)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web._newclient.HTTPParser (and therefore Agent) now handles
   HTTP headers delimited by bare LF newlines. (#3833)
 - twisted.web.client.downloadPage now accepts the `afterFoundGet`
   parameter, with the same meaning as the `getPage` parameter of the

 - twisted.web will now properly specify an encoding (UTF-8) on error,
   redirect, and directory listing pages, so that IE7 and previous
   will not improperly guess the 'utf7' encoding in these cases.
   Please note that Twisted still sets a *default* content-type of
   'text/html', and you shouldn't rely on that: you should set the
   encoding appropriately in your application. (#4900)
 - twisted.web.http.Request.setHost now sets the port in the host
   header if it is not the default. (#4918)
 - default NOT_IMPLEMENTED and NOT_ALLOWED pages now quote the request
   method and URI respectively, to protect against browsers which
   don't quote those values for us. (#4978)

 - Some broken links were fixed, descriptions were updated, and new
   API links were added in the Resource Templating documentation
   (resource-templates.xhtml) (#4968)

   using withRequest to cause them to be passed the HTTP request
   object. (#3073)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.QueryProtocol.handleResponse now disconnects
   from the server, meaning that Twisted XML-RPC clients disconnect
   from the server as soon as they receive a response, rather than
   relying on the server to disconnect. (#2518)
 - twisted.web.twcgi now generates responses containing all
   occurrences of duplicate headers produced by CGI scripts, not just
   the last value. (#4742)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.web.trp, which has been deprecated since Twisted 9.0, was
   removed. (#4299)

Other

   with an error. (#4411)
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.XMLRPC will now no longer trigger a RuntimeError
   by trying to write responses to closed connections. (#4423)

   doc/web/howto/client.xhtml. (#4507)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.web.twcgi.PHP3Script and twisted.web.twcgi.PHPScript are
   now deprecated. (#516)

Other
-----
 - #4403, #4452

===============================

Features
--------
 - Twisted Web in 60 Seconds, a series of short tutorials with self-
   contained examples on a range of common web topics, is now a part
   of the Twisted Web howto documentation. (#4192)

Bugfixes
--------
 - Data and File from twisted.web.static and
   twisted.web.distrib.UserDirectory will now only generate a 200
   response for GET or HEAD requests.
   twisted.web.client.HTTPPageGetter will no longer ignore the case of

   Banana error when writing more than 640kB at once to the request
   object. (#3212)

 - The Error, PageRedirect, and InfiniteRedirection exception in
   twisted.web now initialize an empty message parameter by mapping
   the HTTP status code parameter to a descriptive string. Previously
   the lookup would always fail, leaving message empty.  (#3806)

 - The 'wsgi.input' WSGI environment object now supports -1 and None
   as arguments to the read and readlines methods. (#4114)

 - twisted.web.wsgi doesn't unquote QUERY_STRING anymore, thus
   complying with the WSGI reference implementation. (#4143)

 - The HTTP proxy will no longer pass on keep-alive request headers
   from the client, preventing pages from loading then "hanging"
   (leaving the connection open with no hope of termination). (#4179)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - Remove '--static' option from twistd web, that served as an alias
   for the '--path' option. (#3907)

   logging in with ANONYMOUS credentials when no Authorization header is
   provided in a request (#3924, #3936)
 - HTTPClientFactory now accepts a parameter to enable a common deviation from
   the HTTP 1.1 standard by responding to redirects in a POSTed request with a

   (#886, #3987)

Fixes
-----

   encoded directory separators) will now result in a 404 instead of a 500
   (#3549, #3469)
 - When specifying a followRedirect argument to the getPage function, the state
   of redirect-following for other getPage calls should now be unaffected.  It
   was previously overwriting a class attribute which would affect outstanding
   getPage calls (#3192)
 - Downloading an URL of the form "http://example.com:/" will now work,
   ignoring the extraneous colon (#2402)

   microdom's methods in general should now issue more meaningful exceptions
   when invalid parameters are passed (#3421)

   their responses by the twisted.web server. In addition, WSGI applications
   will no longer be able to specify the server-restricted headers Server and

   of returning a 500 error (#3601)
 - Certain request-bound memory and file resources are cleaned up slightly
   sooner by the request when the connection is lost (#1621, #3176)
 - xmlrpclib.DateTime objects should now correctly round-trip over twisted.web's
   XMLRPC support in all supported versions of Python, and errors during error
   serialization will no longer hang a twisted.web XMLRPC response (#2446)
 - request.content should now always be seeked to the beginning when
   request.process is called, so application code should never need to seek
   back manually (#3585)
 - Fetching a child of static.File with a double-slash in the URL (such as
   "example//foo.html") should now return a 404 instead of a traceback and
   500 error (#3631)
 - downloadPage will now fire a Failure on its returned Deferred instead of
   indicating success when the connection is prematurely lost (#3645)
 - static.File will now provide a 404 instead of a 500 error when it was
   constructed with a non-existent file (#3634)
 - microdom should now serialize namespaces correctly (#3672)
 - The HTTP Auth support resource wrapper should no longer corrupt requests and
   cause them to skip a segment in the request path (#3679)
 - The twisted.web WSGI support should now include leading slashes in PATH_INFO,
   and SCRIPT_NAME will be empty if the application is at the root of the
   resource tree. This means that WSGI applications should no longer generate

   (#3721)
 - WSGI applications should now receive the requesting client's IP in the
   REMOTE_ADDR environment variable (#3730)

   refactoring of twisted.web's header support (#3697)
 - static.File now supports multiple ranges specified in the Range header
   (#3574)
 - static.File should now generate a correct Content-Length value when the
   requested Range value doesn't fit entirely within the file's contents (#3814)
 - Attempting to call request.finish() after the connection has been lost will
   now immediately raise a RuntimeError (#4013)
 - An HTTP-auth resource should now be able to directly render the wrapped
   avatar, whereas before it would only allow retrieval of child resources
   (#4014)
 - twisted.web's wsgi support should no longer attempt to call request.finish
   twice, which would cause errors in certain cases (#4025)
 - WSGI applications should now be able to handle requests with large bodies
   (#4029)
 - Exceptions raised from WSGI applications should now more reliably be turned
   into 500 errors on the HTTP level (#4019)
 - DeferredResource now correctly passes through exceptions raised from the
   wrapped resource, instead of turning them all into 500 errors (#3932)
 - Agent.request now generates a Host header when no headers are passed at
