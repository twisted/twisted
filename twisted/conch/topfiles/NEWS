Twisted Conch 10.2.0 (2010-11-29)
=================================

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.conch.ssh.factory.SSHFactory no longer disables coredumps.
   (#2715)
 - The Deferred returned by twisted.conch.telnet.TelnetTransport.will
   now fires with an OptionRefused failure if the peer responds with a
   refusal for the option negotiation. (#4231)
 - SSHServerTransport and SSHClientTransport in
   twisted.conch.ssh.transport no longer use PyCrypto to generate
   random numbers for DH KEX.  They also now generate values from the
   full valid range, rather than only half of it. (#4469)
 - twisted.conch.ssh.connection.SSHConnection now errbacks leftover
   request deferreds on connection shutdown. (#4483)

Other
-----
 - #4677


Twisted Conch 10.1.0 (2010-06-27)

   ssh protocol versions to be overriden. (#4428)

Bugfixes
--------
 - SSHSessionProcessProtocol now doesn't close the session when stdin
   is closed, but instead when both stdout and stderr are. (#4350)
 - The 'cftp' command-line tool will no longer encounter an
   intermittent error, crashing at startup with a ZeroDivisionError
   while trying to report progress. (#4463)
 - twisted.conch.ssh.connection.SSHConnection now replies to requests
   to open an unknown channel with a OPEN_UNKNOWN_CHANNEL_TYPE message
   instead of closing the connection. (#4490)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------

   Twisted 9.0. (#4097)
 - Removed twisted.conch.ssh.common.Entropy, as Entropy.get_bytes has

   attribute of Entropy. (#4098)

   deprecated since 2007.  Also updated the conch examples
   sshsimpleserver.py and sshsimpleclient.py to reflect this removal.
   (#4099)
 - Removed twisted.conch.ssh.keys.makePublicKeyString, which has been
   deprecated since 2007. (#4100)

   deprecated since 2007. (#4103)

Twisted Conch 9.0.0 (2009-11-24)
================================

Fixes

   (#2682)
 - The SSHv2 server now sends "exit-signal" messages to the client, instead of
   raising an exception, when a process dies due to a signal (#2687)

   no shell (#3914)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - The buggy SSH connection sharing feature of the SSHv2 client was removed
   (#3498)
 - Use of strings and PyCrypto objects to represent keys is deprecated in favor
   of using Conch Key objects (#2682)
