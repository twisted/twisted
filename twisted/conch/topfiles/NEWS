   at connection setup).  It also queues non-key exchange messages
   sent during key exchange to avoid corrupting the connection state.

   twisted.conch.ssh.transport no longer use PyCrypto to generate
   random numbers for DH KEX.  They also now generate values from the
   full valid range, rather than only half of it. (#4469)
 - twisted.conch.ssh.connection.SSHConnection now errbacks leftover
   request deferreds on connection shutdown. (#4483)

   deprecated since 2007.  Also updated the conch examples
   sshsimpleserver.py and sshsimpleclient.py to reflect this removal.
   (#4099)
 - Removed twisted.conch.ssh.keys.makePublicKeyString, which has been
   deprecated since 2007. (#4100)

   (#3498)
 - Use of strings and PyCrypto objects to represent keys is deprecated in favor
