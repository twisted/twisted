  - Insults support for handling more keystrokes and more methods for
    terminal manipulation
  - New, simple insults-based widget library added

 Better test coverage:
  - Dependence on `localhost' name removed
  - Some timing-sensitive tests changed to be more reliable
  - Process spawning tests initialize environment more robustly

  - Add --reconnect option to conch binary
  - utmp/wtmp logging
  - Unix login improvements, PAM support
  - Add "cftp" -- Conch SFTP.
  - Deferred retrieval of public keys is supported

	- Many others

 New functionality:
  - twisted.conch.telnet: new, much improved telnet implementation.
  - twisted.conch.insults: Basic curses-like terminal support (server-side).
  - twisted.conch.manhole: new interactive python interactive interpreter,
