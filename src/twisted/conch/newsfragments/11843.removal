PyAsn1 has been removed as a conch dependency.

twisted.conch.ssh.keys.Key no longer supports loading "alternate" OpenSSH private keys.
These are some private keys that at some point were handled by OpenSSH but for which no specification exists.
For more info about these OpenSSH keys see https://github.com/twisted/twisted/issues/3008.
