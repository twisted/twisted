twisted.conch.ssh.SSHTransportBase now implements stricter checks for
the peer SSH version string as defined in RFC 4253 section 4.2.
The version string length is limited to 255 character and null characters are not allowed.
It also rejects any connection that doesn't start with `SSH-` and no longer
ignores the lines received before the version string.
