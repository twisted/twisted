twisted.web.distrib.UserDirectory.getChild(), twisted.web.resource.Resource.putChild(), twisted.web.script.ResourceScriptDirectory.getChild(), and twisted.web.static.File.getChild() will now raise a TypeError if passed a path which is not bytes.  This eliminates problems where a unicode path passed to these functions would not fail immediately with an exception, but would fail silently due to not being able to match paths which are stored as bytes.  This type of failure was difficult to diagnose, and happened a lot on Python 3.
