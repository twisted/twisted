In Twisted 16.3.0, we changed twisted.web to stop dispatching HTTP/1.1
pipelined requests to application code.  There was a bug in this change which
still allowed clients which could send multiple full HTTP requests in a single
TCP segment to trigger asynchronous processing of later requests, which could
lead to out-of-order responses.  This has now been corrected and twisted.web
should never process a pipelined request over HTTP/1.1 until the previous
request has fully completed.
