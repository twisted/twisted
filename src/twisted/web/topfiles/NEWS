Twisted Web 16.5.0 (2016-10-28)
===============================

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.client.HTTPConnectionPool and anything that uses it,
   like twisted.web.client.Agent, have had their logic for resuming
   transports changed so that transports are resumed after state
   machine transitions are complete, rather than before. This change
   allows the HTTP client infrastructure to work with alternative HTTP
   implementations such as HTTP/2 which may be able to deliver a
   complete response synchronously when producing is resumed. (#8720)

Other
-----
 - #8519, #8530, #8629, #8707, #8777, #8778, #8844


Twisted Web 16.4.1 (2016-09-07)
===============================

No significant changes have been made for this release.


Twisted Web 16.4.0 (2016-08-25)
===============================

Features
--------
 - Twisted web HTTP/2 servers now time out HTTP/2 connections in the
   same manner as HTTP/1.1 connections. (#8480)

Bugfixes
--------
 - A bug in twisted.web.server.Site.makeSession which may lead to
   predictable session IDs was fixed.  Session IDs are now generated
   securely using `os.urandom`. (#3460)
 - twisted.web.server.Request.getSession will now, for a request sent
   over HTTPS, set a "Secure" cookie, preventing the secure session
   from being sent over plain-text HTTP. (#3461)
 - If called multiple times, twisted.web.http.Request.setLastModified
   now correctly observes the greatest supplied value. (#3807)
 - The HTTP server now correctly times connections out. (broken in
   16.2) (#8481)
 - Twisted's HTTP/2 support no longer throws priority exceptions when
   WINDOW_UDPATE frames are received after a response has been
   completed. (#8558)
 - twisted.web.twcgi.CGIScript will now not pass the "Proxy" header to
   CGI scripts, as a mitigation to CVE-2016-1000111. (#8623)
 - Twisted Web's HTTP/2 server can now tolerate streams being reset by
   the client midway through a data upload without throwing
   exceptions. (#8682)
 - twisted.web.http.Request now swallows header writes on reset HTTP/2
   streams, rather than erroring out. (#8685)
 - twisted.web's HTTP/2 server now tolerates receiving WINDOW_UPDATE
   frames for streams for which it has no outstanding data to send.
   (#8695)
 - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel now resumes producing on finished,
   non-persistent connections. This prevents HTTP/1 servers using TLS
   from leaking a CLOSE_WAIT socket per request. (#8766)

Other
-----
 - #8519, #8530, #8629, #8707


Twisted Web 16.3.0 (2016-07-05)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel now implements ITransport. Along with
   this change, twisted.web.http.Request now directs all its writes to
   the HTTPChannel, rather than to the backing transport. This change
   is required for future HTTP/2 work. (#8191)
 - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel now has a HTTP/2 implementation which
   will be used if the transport has negotiated using it through
   ALPN/NPN (see #8188). (#8194)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.client.Agent and twisted.web.client.ProxyAgent now add
   brackets to IPv6 literal addresses in the host header they send.
   (#8369)
 - The HTTP server now correctly times connections out. (broken in
   16.2) (#8481)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.web would previously dispatch pipelined requests
   simultaneously and queue the responses. This behaviour did not
   enforce any of the guarantees required by RFC 7230 or make it
   possible for users to enforce those requirements. For this reason,
   the parallel dispatch of requests has been removed. Pipelined
   requests are now processed serially. (#8320)


Twisted Web 16.2.0 (2016-05-18)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.http.HTTPFactory's constructor now accepts a reactor
   argument, for explicit reactor selection. (#8246)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel.headerReceived now respond with 400
   and disconnect when a malformed header is received. (#8101)
 - twisted.web.http.Request once again has a reference to the
   HTTPFactory which created it, the absence of which was preventing
   log messages from being created.  (#8272)
 - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel no longer processes requests that have
   invalid headers as the final header in their header block. (#8317)
 - twisted.web.client.HTTPClientFactory (and the getPage and
   downloadPage APIs) now timeouts correctly on TLS connections where
   the remote party is not responding on the connection. (#8318)

Other
-----
 - #8300


Twisted Web 16.1.1 (2016-04-08)
===============================

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.http.Request once again has a reference to the
   HTTPFactory which created it, the absence of which was preventing
   log messages from being created.  (#8272)


Twisted Web 16.1.0 (2016-04-04)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.http.Request.addCookie now supports both unicode and
   bytes arguments, with unicode arguments being encoded to UTF-8.
   (#8067)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.util.DeferredResource no longer causes spurious
   "Unhandled error in Deferred" log messages. (#8192)
 - twisted.web.server.site.makeSession now generates an uid of type
   bytes on both Python 2 and 3. (#8215)

Other
-----
 - #8238


Twisted Web 16.0.0 (2016-03-10)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.http_headers._DictHeaders now correctly handles
   updating via keyword arguments in Python 3 (therefore
   twisted.web.http_headers is now fully ported to Python 3). (#6082)
 - twisted.web.wsgi has been ported to Python 3. (#7993)
 - twisted.web.http_headers.Headers now accepts both Unicode and
   bytestring keys and values, encoding to iso-8859-1 and utf8
   respectively. (#8129)
 - twisted.web.vhost ported to Python 3. (#8132)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel now correctly handles non-ascii method
   name by returning 400. Previously non-ascii method name was causing
   unhandled exceptions. (#8102)
 - twisted.web.static.File on Python 3 now redirects paths to
   directories without a trailing slash, to a path with a trailing
   slash, as on Python 2. (#8169)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.web.http.Request's headers and request_headers attributes,
   deprecated since Twisted 13.2, have been removed. (#8136)
 - twisted.web.static.addSlash is deprecated. (#8169)

Other
-----
 - #8140, #8182


Twisted Web 15.5.0 (2015-11-28)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.http.Request.addCookie now supports the httpOnly
   attribute which when set on cookies prevents the browser exposing
   it through channels other than HTTP and HTTPS requests (i.e. they
   will not be accessible through JavaScript). (#5911)
 - twisted.web.client.downloadPage is now ported to Python 3. (#6197)
 - twisted.web.client.Agent is now ported to Python 3. (#7407)
 - twisted.web.tap (ran when calling `twistd web`) has now been ported
   to Python 3. Not all features are enabled -- CGI, WSGI, and
   distributed web serving will be enabled in their respective tickets
   as they are ported. (#8008)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.client.URI now supports IPv6 addresses. Previously this
   would mistake the colons used as IPv6 address group separators as
   the start of a port specification. (#7650)
 - twisted.web.util's failure template has been moved inline to work
   around Python 3 distribution issues. (#8047)
 - twisted.web.http.Request on Python 3 now handles multipart/form-
   data requests correctly. (#8052)

 - twisted.web.html is now deprecated in favor of
   twisted.web.template. (#4948)

Other
-----
 - #7895, #7942, #7949, #7952, #7975


Twisted Web 15.2.1 (2015-05-23)

   rendering forbidden pages. (#6951)

Other
-----
 - #7000, #7485, #7750, #7762


Twisted Web 15.0.0 (2015-01-24)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.client.Agent.usingEndpointFactory allows creating an
   Agent that connects in non-standard ways, e.g. via a proxy or a
   UNIX socket. (#6634)
 - The Deferred returned by twisted.web.client.readBody can now be
   cancelled. (#6686)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.web.iweb.IRequest.getClient is now deprecated.  Its
   implementation in Twisted, twisted.web.http.Request.getClient, is
   also deprecated and will no longer attempt to resolve the client IP
   address to a hostname. (#2252)

Other
-----
 - #7247, #7302, #7680, #7689


Twisted Web 14.0.2 (2014-09-18)
===============================

No significant changes have been made for this release.


Twisted Web 14.0.1 (2014-09-17)
===============================

Bugfixes
--------
 - BrowserLikePolicyForHTTPS would always ignore the specified
   trustRoot and use the system trust root instead, which has been
   rectified. (#7647)


Twisted Web 14.0.0 (2014-05-08)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web.http.proxiedLogFormatter can now be used with
   twisted.web.http.HTTPFactory (and subclasses) to record X
   -Forwarded-For values to the access log when the HTTP server is
   deployed behind a reverse proxy. (#1468)
 - twisted.web.client.Agent now uses
   twisted.internet.ssl.CertificateOptions for SSL/TLS and benefits
   from its continuous improvements. (#6893)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.client.Agent now correctly manage flow-control on
   pooled connections, and therefore requests will no longer hang
   sometimes when deliverBody is not called synchronously within the
   callback on Request. (#6751)
 - twisted.web.client.Agent now verifies that the provided server
   certificate in a TLS connection is trusted by the platform. (#7042)
 - When requesting an HTTPS URL with twisted.web.client.Agent, the
   hostname of the presented certificate will be checked against the
   requested hostname; mismatches will now result in an error rather
   than a man-in-the-middle opportunity for attackers.  This may break
   existing code that incorrectly depended on insecure behavior, but
   such code was erroneous and should be updated.  (#4888)

Other
-----
 - #5004, #6881, #6956


Twisted Web 13.2.0 (2013-10-29)
===============================

Features
--------
 - IAgent has been added to twisted.web.iweb to explicitly define the
   interface implemented by the various "Agent" classes in
   twisted.web.client. (#6702)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.client.Response.deliverBody now calls connectionLost on
   the body protocol for responses with no body (such as 204, 304, and
   HEAD requests). (#5476)
 - twisted.web.static.loadMimeTypes now uses all available system MIME
   types. (#5717)

Twisted Web 13.1.0 (2013-06-23)
===============================

Features
--------
 - The deferred returned by twisted.web.client.Agent.request can now
   be cancelled. (#4330)
 - twisted.web.client.BrowserLikeRedirectAgent, a new redirect agent,
   treats HTTP 301 and 302 like HTTP 303 on non-HEAD/GET requests,
   changing the method to GET before proceeding. (#5434)
 - The new attribute twisted.web.iweb.IResponse.request is a reference
   to a provider of the new twisted.web.iweb.IClientRequest interface
   which, among other things, provides a way to access the request's
   absolute URI. It is now also possible to inspect redirect history
   with twisted.web.iweb.IResponse.previousResponse. (#5435)
 - twisted.web.client.RedirectAgent now supports relative URI
   references in the Location HTTP header. (#5462)
 - twisted.web.client now provides readBody to collect the body of a
   response from Agent into a string. (#6251)

   first one provided. (#104)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel.headerReceived now catches the error
   if the Content-Length header is not an integer and return a 400 Bad
   Request response. (#6029)
 - twisted.web.http.HTTPChannel now drops the connection and issues a
   400 error upon receipt of a chunk-encoding encoded request with a
   bad chunk-length field. (#6030)

Improved Documentation
----------------------
 - twisted.web.iweb.IRequest now documents its `content` attribute and
   a new "web in 60 seconds" howto demonstrates its use. (#6181)

   (#4017)
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.XMLRPC now allows its lookupProcedure method to
   be overridden to change how XML-RPC procedures are dispatched.
   (#4836)
 - A new HTTP cookie-aware Twisted Web Agent wrapper is included in
   twisted.web.client.CookieAgent (#4922)

   support to the HTTP 1.1 client stack. (#5157)
 - twisted.web.template now supports HTML tags from the HTML5
   standard, including <canvas> and <video>. (#5306)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.client.getPage and .downloadPage now only fire their
   result Deferred after the underlying connection they use has been
   closed. (#3796)
 - twisted.web.server now omits the default Content-Type header from
   NOT MODIFIED responses. (#4156)
 - twisted.web.server now responds correctly to 'Expect: 100-continue'
   headers, although this is not yet usefully exposed to user code.
   (#4673)
 - twisted.web.client.Agent no longer raises an exception if a server
   responds and closes the connection before the request has been
   fully transmitted. (#5013)

 - CookieAgent is now documented in the twisted.web.client how-to.
   (#5110)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - twisted.web.google is now deprecated. (#5209)

Other
-----
 - #4951, #5057, #5175, #5288, #5316


Twisted Web 11.0.0 (2011-04-01)
===============================

Features
--------
 - twisted.web._newclient.HTTPParser (and therefore Agent) now handles
   HTTP headers delimited by bare LF newlines. (#3833)
 - twisted.web.client.downloadPage now accepts the `afterFoundGet`
   parameter, with the same meaning as the `getPage` parameter of the
   same name. (#4364)
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.Proxy constructor now takes additional 'timeout'
   and 'reactor' arguments. The 'timeout' argument defaults to 30
   seconds. (#4741)
 - Twisted Web now has a templating system, twisted.web.template,
   which is a direct, simplified derivative of Divmod Nevow. (#4939)

 - twisted.web will now properly specify an encoding (UTF-8) on error,
   redirect, and directory listing pages, so that IE7 and previous
   will not improperly guess the 'utf7' encoding in these cases.
   Please note that Twisted still sets a *default* content-type of
   'text/html', and you shouldn't rely on that: you should set the
   encoding appropriately in your application. (#4900)
 - twisted.web.http.Request.setHost now sets the port in the host
   header if it is not the default. (#4918)
 - default NOT_IMPLEMENTED and NOT_ALLOWED pages now quote the request
   method and URI respectively, to protect against browsers which
   don't quote those values for us. (#4978)

   using withRequest to cause them to be passed the HTTP request
   object. (#3073)

Bugfixes
--------
 - twisted.web.xmlrpc.QueryProtocol.handleResponse now disconnects
   from the server, meaning that Twisted XML-RPC clients disconnect
   from the server as soon as they receive a response, rather than
   relying on the server to disconnect. (#2518)
 - twisted.web.twcgi now generates responses containing all
   occurrences of duplicate headers produced by CGI scripts, not just
   the last value. (#4742)

Deprecations and Removals

   contained examples on a range of common web topics, is now a part
   of the Twisted Web howto documentation. (#4192)

Bugfixes
--------
 - Data and File from twisted.web.static and
   twisted.web.distrib.UserDirectory will now only generate a 200
   response for GET or HEAD requests.
   twisted.web.client.HTTPPageGetter will no longer ignore the case of
   a request method when considering whether to apply special HEAD
   processing to a response. (#446)

 - twisted.web.http.HTTPClient now supports multi-line headers.
   (#2062)

 - Resources served via twisted.web.distrib will no longer encounter a
   Banana error when writing more than 640kB at once to the request
   object. (#3212)

 - The Error, PageRedirect, and InfiniteRedirection exception in
   twisted.web now initialize an empty message parameter by mapping
   the HTTP status code parameter to a descriptive string. Previously
   the lookup would always fail, leaving message empty.  (#3806)

 - The 'wsgi.input' WSGI environment object now supports -1 and None
   as arguments to the read and readlines methods. (#4114)

 - twisted.web.wsgi doesn't unquote QUERY_STRING anymore, thus
   complying with the WSGI reference implementation. (#4143)

 - The HTTP proxy will no longer pass on keep-alive request headers
   from the client, preventing pages from loading then "hanging"
   (leaving the connection open with no hope of termination). (#4179)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - Remove '--static' option from twistd web, that served as an alias
   for the '--path' option. (#3907)

Twisted Web 9.0.0 (2009-11-24)
==============================

Features
--------
 - There is now an iweb.IRequest interface which specifies the interface that
   request objects provide (#3416)
 - downloadPage now supports the same cookie, redirect, and timeout features
   that getPage supports (#2971)
 - A chapter about WSGI has been added to the twisted.web documentation (#3510)
 - The HTTP auth support in the web server now allows anonymous sessions by
   logging in with ANONYMOUS credentials when no Authorization header is
   provided in a request (#3924, #3936)
 - HTTPClientFactory now accepts a parameter to enable a common deviation from
   the HTTP 1.1 standard by responding to redirects in a POSTed request with a
   GET instead of another POST (#3624)
 - A new basic HTTP/1.1 client API is included in twisted.web.client.Agent
   (#886, #3987)

Fixes
-----
 - Requests for "insecure" children of a static.File (such as paths containing
   encoded directory separators) will now result in a 404 instead of a 500
   (#3549, #3469)
 - When specifying a followRedirect argument to the getPage function, the state
   of redirect-following for other getPage calls should now be unaffected.  It
   was previously overwriting a class attribute which would affect outstanding
   getPage calls (#3192)
 - Downloading an URL of the form "http://example.com:/" will now work,
   ignoring the extraneous colon (#2402)
 - microdom's appendChild method will no longer issue a spurious warning, and
   microdom's methods in general should now issue more meaningful exceptions
   when invalid parameters are passed (#3421)
 - WSGI applications will no longer have spurious Content-Type headers added to
   their responses by the twisted.web server. In addition, WSGI applications
   will no longer be able to specify the server-restricted headers Server and
   Date (#3569)
 - http_headers.Headers now normalizes the case of raw headers passed directly
   to it in the same way that it normalizes the headers passed to setRawHeaders
   (#3557)

 - twisted.web.domhelpers now works with both microdom and minidom (#3600)
 - twisted.web servers will now ignore invalid If-Modified-Since headers instead
   of returning a 500 error (#3601)
 - Certain request-bound memory and file resources are cleaned up slightly
   sooner by the request when the connection is lost (#1621, #3176)
 - xmlrpclib.DateTime objects should now correctly round-trip over twisted.web's
   XMLRPC support in all supported versions of Python, and errors during error
   serialization will no longer hang a twisted.web XMLRPC response (#2446)
 - request.content should now always be seeked to the beginning when
   request.process is called, so application code should never need to seek
   back manually (#3585)
 - Fetching a child of static.File with a double-slash in the URL (such as
   "example//foo.html") should now return a 404 instead of a traceback and
   500 error (#3631)
 - downloadPage will now fire a Failure on its returned Deferred instead of
   indicating success when the connection is prematurely lost (#3645)
 - static.File will now provide a 404 instead of a 500 error when it was
   constructed with a non-existent file (#3634)
 - microdom should now serialize namespaces correctly (#3672)
 - The HTTP Auth support resource wrapper should no longer corrupt requests and
   cause them to skip a segment in the request path (#3679)
 - The twisted.web WSGI support should now include leading slashes in PATH_INFO,
   and SCRIPT_NAME will be empty if the application is at the root of the
   resource tree. This means that WSGI applications should no longer generate
   URLs with double-slashes in them even if they naively concatenate the values
   (#3721)
 - WSGI applications should now receive the requesting client's IP in the
   REMOTE_ADDR environment variable (#3730)
 - The distrib module should work again. It was unfortunately broken with the
   refactoring of twisted.web's header support (#3697)
 - static.File now supports multiple ranges specified in the Range header
   (#3574)
 - static.File should now generate a correct Content-Length value when the
   requested Range value doesn't fit entirely within the file's contents (#3814)
 - Attempting to call request.finish() after the connection has been lost will
   now immediately raise a RuntimeError (#4013)
 - An HTTP-auth resource should now be able to directly render the wrapped
   avatar, whereas before it would only allow retrieval of child resources
   (#4014)
 - twisted.web's wsgi support should no longer attempt to call request.finish
   twice, which would cause errors in certain cases (#4025)
 - WSGI applications should now be able to handle requests with large bodies
   (#4029)
 - Exceptions raised from WSGI applications should now more reliably be turned
   into 500 errors on the HTTP level (#4019)
 - DeferredResource now correctly passes through exceptions raised from the
   wrapped resource, instead of turning them all into 500 errors (#3932)
 - Agent.request now generates a Host header when no headers are passed at
   (#4131)

-------------------------
 - The unmaintained and untested twisted.web.monitor module was removed (#2763)
 - The twisted.web.woven package has been removed (#1522)

   twisted.web.resource, and accessing them through twisted.web.error is now
   deprecated (#3035)

   various things have been deprecated (#3457)
   - the loopFactory attribute is now ignored
