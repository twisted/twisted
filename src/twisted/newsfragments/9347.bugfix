twisted.logger.formatEvent now honors dotted method names, not just flat
function names, in format strings, as it has long been explicitly documented to
do.  So, you will now get the expected result from `formatEvent("here's the
result of calling a method at log-format time: {obj.method()}", obj=...)`
