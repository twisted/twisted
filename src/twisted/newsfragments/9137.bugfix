twisted.internet.interfaces.IResolverSimple implementers will now always be passed bytes, properly IDNA encoded if required, on Python 2. On Python 3, they will now be passed correctly IDNA-encoded Unicode forms of the domain, taking advantage of the idna library from PyPI if possible. This is to avoid Python's standard library (which has an out of date idna module) from mis-encoding domain names when non-ASCII Unicode is passed to it.
