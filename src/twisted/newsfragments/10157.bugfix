twisted.trial._dist.worker.LocalWorker.connectionMade now always writes the
log file using UTF-8 encoding.
In previous versions it was using the system default encoding.
This was causing encoding errors as the distributed trial workers are sending
Unicode data and the system default encoding might not always be Unicode compatible.
For example, it can be CP1252 on Windows.
