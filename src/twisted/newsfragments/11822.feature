twisted.python.filepath.FilePath and related classes (twisted.python.filepath.IFilepath, twisted.python.filepath.AbstractFilePath, twisted.python.zippath.ZipPath, and twisted.python.zippath.ZipArchive) now have type annotations.  Additionally, FilePath is now generic, describing its mode, so you can annotate variables as FilePath[str] or FilePath[bytes] depending on the types that you wish to get back from the 'path' attribute and related methods like 'basename'.
