twisted.application.internet.ClientService.whenConnected now accepts an argument "failAfterFailures". If you set this to 1, the Deferred returned by whenConnected will errback when the connection attempt fails, rather than retrying forever. This lets you react (probably by stopping the ClientService) to connection errors that are likely to be persistent, such as using the wrong hostname, or not being connected to the internet at all.
