Twisted Pair 15.0.0: Very low-level networking functionality

Twisted Pair includes parsers for several datagram formats, including ethernet,
IP, and UDP.  It also offers low-level networking integration on Linux via tun
and tap devices.

Twisted Pair depends on Twisted Core.

To be able to run the Twisted Pair test suite as an unprivileged user, you need
to create a tunnel device owned by that user.  Likewise, to use Twisted Pair's
tuntap support as an unprivileged user, you must do the same.  See the
configuration howto for details.
