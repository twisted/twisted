; tox configuration file for running tests.
;
; The main trial based environments are defined based on a set of factors. Each
; factor will trigger a different behavior. Multiple factors can be set for the
; same environment:
;
; * alldeps - install all possible dependencies.
; * nodeps - avoid installing any dependencies apart from testing tools.
; * withcov - run the tests wrapped using the coverage.
; * nocov - run the tests directly, without using the coverage wrapper.
; * release-prepare - build the sdist and wheel distribution and run tests for them
; * posix - prepare the tests to be run in a Linux/Unix/macOS environment.
; * macos - prepare the tests to be run in a macOS 10.11+ environment (superset of posix)
; * windows - prepare the tests to be executed under Windows.
;
; See README.rst for example tox commands.
;
; There are also various non-default environments used by the continuous
; integration system: the `codecov-push` and `coveralls-push` push the coverage
; results to codecov.io and coveralls.io, respectively. They should be called
; after running both some number of `-withcov` environments and also
; `coverage-prepare`.
;
; For compatibility with the current infrastructure, `codecov-publish`
; combines `coverage-prepare` and `codecov-push` into a single step.
