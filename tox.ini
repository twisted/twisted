; tox configuration file for running tests.
;
; The main trial based environments are defined based on a set of factors. Each
; factor will trigger a different behavior. Multiple factors can be set for the
; same environment:
;
; * alldeps - install all possible dependencies.
; * nodeps - avoid installing any dependencies apart from testing tools.
; * withcov - run the tests wrapped using the coverage.
; * nocov - run the tests directly, without using the coverage wrapper.
; * release-prepare - build the sdist and wheel distribution and run tests for them
; * posix - prepare the tests to be run in a Linux/Unix/macOS environment.
; * macos - prepare the tests to be run in a macOS 10.11+ environment (superset of posix)
; * windows - prepare the tests to be executed under Windows.
;
; See README.rst for example tox commands.
