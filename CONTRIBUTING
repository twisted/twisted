Contributing to Twisted
=======================

As an open source project, Twisted welcomes contributions of many forms.

Examples of contributions include:

* Code patches
* Documentation improvements
* Bug reports and patch reviews

Extensive contribution guidelines are available online at:

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/ContributingToTwistedLabs

**Warning: pull requests are ignored!** File a ticket at:

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/newticket

Twisted uses Trac to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and associated
patches because GitHub doesn't provide adequate tooling for its community.
