Twisted uses Trac to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and associated
patches because GitHub doesn't provide adequate tooling for its community.

Contributions are managed using GitHub's Pull Requests.
For a PR to be accepted it needs to have:

* all Travis CI tests passing
* patch coverage of 100% as reported by codecov.io

The Travis CI tests currently represent only a subset of the all the platforms Twisted supports, so the buildbot tests are still the actual gate for PR acceptance.
