"""
An example IRC log bot - logs a channel's events to a file.

If someone says the bot's name in the channel followed by a ':',
e.g.

    <foo> logbot: hello!

the bot will reply:

    <logbot> foo: I am a log bot

Run this script with two arguments, the channel name the bot should
connect to, and file to log to, e.g.:

    $ python ircLogBot.py test test.log

will log channel #test to the file 'test.log'.

To run the script:

    $ python ircLogBot.py <channel> <file>
