Washort says, "Oh, did i ever tell you about the Java assignment i had at the beginning of the semester?"
Washort says, "I was bored so i did it without any loops or temp variables."

<Acapnotic> Texas does not come in eight ounce plastic containers with tinfoil lids.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no "fruit on the bottom" version of Texas.  Texas is not available in the dairy section of your grocer.  Texas does not help fufill your daily dietary requirement of calcium.

<dash> looks like we have people who just totally fall off our radar because they're totally happy with twisted and dont _need_ to say anything =)

<spiv> glyph: You have the deepest insight into XML of anyone I know ;)
%
<mesozoic> I tried adding one in coil, and got more errors.  I'm not sure if I'm going about it properly.  Is there any other way to configure a vhost?  
<ameoba> call the vhost-bustters
%
<Jerub> I got in trouble for drawing a smiley face on a gantt chart.

* moshez does the evil lowering squishation resistance level dance.
%
<glyph> CDATA is not an integration strategy.

<nessus> The PSU?  Is that that thing that I used to send $50 a year to?

<sjj> skreech: you go to all classes?
<skreech> sjj: yes.
<sjj> skreech: why? :)
<sjj> skreech: uni was made to be skipped
<sjj> man, americans must be dedicated students.

* moshez doubts they realize Linux has *WAY* more brand-awareness than SCO, and possibly equal to "UNIX"

<glyph> I've started to think that having a lot of stable, robust stuff and a
	lot of half-finished proof-of-concept stuff in one project is a good
	business model
<glyph> like "You know we can do good work, but we got bored with that bit; if
        you want us to finish it, pay"
<dash> glyph: good, because that's what we have

<itamar> well, the one I was in was pretty nice

<dash> glyph: how many PSU agents did you have to kill to get that working?
<glyph> dash: 3, and they were all waiting just inside the door.  Amateurs.

<glyph> and it's considered a professional courtesy, when you are *invited*
        into a bank, not to steal all their moneys and shoot the managers full
        of assault rifle bullets

<itamar> moshez: I am not an employee
%
<tenth> Doing stuff in MySQL is like getting dates at [name elided to

<tenth> I think we need a god verb "0wnz0r" on the
        reality-pencil-type-thing. I'm not sure exactly what it would do, but I
        think it may be necessary.
%
<dash> Saying that complexity isn't real because it "was invented somewhere else" is the most useless kind of wishful thinking
%
<xcabbage> mind.sf.net crashed my browser
<dash> signs of intelligent life!
%
<glyph> The only thing more absurd than the technology of XML is the politics surrounding it. 
%
<glyph> While it is *possible* that I'm smarter than you think I am, it is certain that I'm more stubborn.

<z3p> glyph: what group of programmers are you picking on tonight?
<glyph> z3p: PyXML again
<z3p> sounds like a blast :)
<glyph> z3p: ugh.  Actually I have a pretty high opinion of some of those people so it bugs me to have to be flaming :)

%
<infinity> moshez : I won't denounce PHP... It still has its uses.. <shrug>...
           I denounced most PHP *users* about a week after adopting it, though.
<infinity> That language attracts more idiots...

<dash> Aco: please do not corrupt our release manager
<dash> Aco: at least not until after 1.0

<radix> hehe yeah the whore house was awesome :D

<bruce> hmmm. i didn't get my 11pm cron output email.
* bruce forgets which cronjob that is though.
<skreech> bruce: nuclear war has erupted. haven't you heard?
<bruce> (or what machine it runs on)
<bruce> (or what user it runs as on what machine)
<glyph> skreech: in 2002, war was beginning

<itamar> yes, but that doesn't make sense, how can you be proud of a civil war?

<jml> is there a doc on twisted's version numbering conventions?

<itamar> dash is *already* pre-strectched
<itamar> he's like 6 feet
<itamar> well
<itamar> he's actualy 1.80 meters
<itamar> or so
<itamar> it's not that he's a giant insect
%
<_moshez> itamar: I'm agaisnt the state too :)
<shapr> _moshez: are you purely functional?
%
<jml> dash: there's an otherwise normal guy at work who uses tcl as his scripting language of choice
%
<sjj> let me tell you something.  I worked at BK for 1 year, and the veggie burgers have more meat than the whoppers, but nobody complained!
%
<sjj> moshez: don't kid yourself, if a cow got the chance he'd eat you and everyone you cared about.
%
<dash> zb0: ok, let me describe what you sound like
<dash> zb0: "Hi. I want to drive a spike through my foot into the floor. Can someone help me with that? I know i dont need to, but there are other things i want to drive spikes into."
%
<itamar> it's "moshez vs. the CS profs of doom"
<dash> itamar: i think in a war with the CS profs of doom, i'd be on moshez's
       side.
<itamar> yes, but your goals are different
<itamar> inevitably your pact would weaken
<dash> itamar: well, we'd fight a duel if we both survived the war.
%
<dash> |mmy: cgi is not an enterprise solution.
%
<_moshez> cyli: oh, yes. what did you think of my flame to val?
<cyli> moshez: i didn't get to read all of it.  glyph kept interrupting me
       with questions of what i thought of it.  and then i had dinner.

<anonymous> i keep forgetting how much *fun* python is without zope
%
<glyph> radix: so ... it doesn't already do what you want?
<radix> glyph: Well, now that I understand that what I wanted is impossible, yes. :-)
<radix> I mean, yes, it does everything that I want, now. ;-)
-vinge.openprojects.net- glyph changed topic: Learn from radix: if Twisted doesn't do what you want, modify your desires.
%
<CainKnight> Right now, I could care less about the best way to do this, or the
             intricacies involved. What I care about is making a function get
             called.
<CainKnight> If that involves ritual sacrifice to dark gods, fine.
<CainKnight> I don't care why the dark gods want chicken blood.
<CainKnight> All I need to know right now is will they accept it and make the
             volcano not wipe out my city.
<CainKnight> Once the volcano is placated, then i can go back and figure out
             that it wasn't the blood, it was the heat mixed with the iron in a
             rich oxygen environment, and adjust the ritual properly in the
             future.

<Yosomono@efnet> I'm so open source that I sequenced my genome and released ISOs

<moshez> I mean, what if you wake up at 4am and need to talk to someone
<dash> moshez: walk into the other room?
<moshez> dash: I'd need to get dressed for that
<dash> moshez: bathrobe
<moshez> dash: I'm sane
<moshez> dash: my bathrobe is in the bathroom
%
<itamar> dash: how'd you learn?
<dash> itamar: lessons
%
<radix> bathrobe is easier than boxers ;-)
<moshez> radix: how so?
<radix> moshez: eh, you have to deal with legs
<radix> a swoosh around the shoulders is easier, I think
<moshez> radix: it takes more presence of mind to tie the belt-thingy
<jml> moshez: compared to buttons on boxers? I think not
<moshez> buttons???????
<moshez> jml: who makes your boxers? Chinese Torture 'R' Us?
%
<moshez> I'm always nice.
%
<moshez> jml: you're like all men, you're afraid of committing
<jml> moshez: it's a deep seated fear of conflict
%
<glyph> bruce_: GPL can't force you to write code under non-MIT/BSD licenses
<exarkun> GPL+mindflayer can though
%
<zen-@ircnet> which the ratio simplicity/expressivitiy of python?
<moshez> 2.49866397309784
<moshez> approximately
<tigrux> moshez ?
<moshez> tigrux: well, it's for Python2.2
<moshez> I haven't had time to modify my calculations for the CVS version
%
<spiv> mjs: You've probably noticed by now that dash is only here to make occasional remarks about Twisted & World Domination... ;)
<mjs> spiv: yeah I starting to notice... but I am sure it will become more fervent when we have a Lisp twisted implementation. =)
<dash> mjs: when that happens, i will become more powerful than you can possibly imagine
