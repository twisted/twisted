    <p><em><strong>Note:</strong> This document is relevant for the
    version of Twisted that was current at <a
    href="http://www.python10.com">IPC10</a>. It has since been
    superseded by many changes to the Python API. It is remaining
    unchanged for historical reasons, but please refer to
    documentation for the specific system you are looking for and
    not these papers for current information.</em></p>

    <h1>The World of Software is a World of Constant Change</h1>

    <p>Twisted has undergone several major revisions since Moshe
    Zadka and I wrote the <a href="ipc10paper.html">"The Twisted
    Network Framework"</a>. Most of these changes have not deviated
    from the central vision of the framework, but almost all of the
    code listings have been re-visited and enhanced in some
    way.</p>

    <p>So, while the paper was correct at the time that it was
    originally written, a few things have changed which have
    invalidated portions of it.</p>

    <p>Most significant is the fact that almost all methods which
    pass callbacks of some kind have been changed to take no
    callback or error-callback arguments, and instead return an
    instance of a <code
    class="API">twisted.python.defer.Deferred</code>. This means
    that an asynchronous function can be easily identified visually
    because it will be of the form: <code
    class="python">async_obj.asyncMethod("foo")<b>.addCallbacks(succeded,
    failed)</b></code>. There is also a utility method <code
    class="python">addCallback</code> which makes it more
    convenient to pass additional arguments to a callback function
    and omit special-case error handling.</p>

    <p>While it is still backwards compatible, <code
    class="API">twisted.internet.passport</code> has been re-named
    to <code class="API">twisted.cred</code>, and the various
    classes in it have been split out into submodules of that
    package, and the various remote-object superclasses have been
    moved out of twisted.spread.pb and put into
    twisted.spread.flavors.</p>

    <p><code class="python">Application.listenOn</code> has been
    replaced with the more descripively named <code
    class="python">Application.listenTCP</code>, <code
    class="python">Application.listenUDP</code>, and <code
    class="python">Application.listenSSL</code>.</p>

    <p><code class="API">twisted.web.widgets</code> has progressed
    quite far since the paper was written! One description
    specifically given in the paper is no longer correct:</p>

    <blockquote>
      The namespace for evaluating the template expressions is
      obtained by scanning the class hierarchy for attributes, and
      getting each of those attributes from the current instance.
      This means that all methods will be bound methods, so
      indicating "self" explicitly is not required. While it is
      possible to override the method for creating namespaces,
      using this default has the effect of associating all
      presentation code for a particular widget in one class, along
      with its template. If one is working with a non-programmer
      designer, and the template is in an external file, it is
      always very clear to the designer what functionality is
      available to them in any given scope, because there is a list
      of available methods for any given class.
    </blockquote>
<p>This is still possible to avoid breakages in old code, but
after some experimentation, it became clear that simply passing
    <code class="python">self</code> was an easier method for
    creating the namespace, both for designers and programmers.</p>
    <p>In addition, since the advent of Zope3, interoperability
    with Zope has become increasingly interesting possibility for
    the Twisted development team, since it would be desirable if
    Twisted could use their excellent strategy for
    content-management, while still maintaining Twisted's
    advantages in the arena of multi-protocol servers. Of
    particular interest has been Zope Presentation Templates, since
    they seem to be a truly robust solution for keeping design
    discrete from code, compatible with the event-based method in
    which twisted.web.widgets processes web requests. <code
    class="API">twisted.web.widgets.ZopePresentationTemplate</code>
    may be opening soon in a theatre near you!</p>
