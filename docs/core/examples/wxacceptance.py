Acceptance tests for wxreactor.

Please test on Linux, Win32 and OS X:
1. Startup event is called at startup.
2. Scheduled event is called after 2 seconds.
3. Shutdown takes 3 seconds, both when quiting from menu and when closing
   window (e.g. Alt-F4 in metacity). This tests reactor.stop() and
   wxApp.ExitEventLoop().
4. 'hello, world' continues to be printed even when modal dialog is open
   (use dialog menu item), when menus are held down, when window is being
   dragged.
