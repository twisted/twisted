"""
Client-side of an example for sending file descriptors between processes over
UNIX sockets.  This client connects to a server listening on a UNIX socket and
waits for one file descriptor to arrive over the connection.  It displays the
name of the file and the first 80 bytes it contains, then exits.

To runb this example, run this program with one argument: a path giving the UNIX
socket the server side of this example is already listening on.  For example:

    $ python recvfd.py /tmp/sendfd.sock

See sendfd.py for the server side of this example.
