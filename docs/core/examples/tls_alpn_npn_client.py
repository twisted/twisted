tls_alpn_npn_client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This test script demonstrates the usage of the acceptableProtocols API as a
client peer.

It performs next protocol negotiation using NPN and ALPN.

It will print what protocol was negotiated and exit.
The global variables are provided as input values.

This is set up to run against the server from
tls_alpn_npn_server.py from the directory that contains this example.

It assumes that you have a self-signed server certificate, named
`server-cert.pem` and located in the working directory.

# The order of the protocols here is an order of preference: most servers will
# attempt to respect our preferences when doing the negotiation. This indicates

# 'h2'), but would also accept HTTP/1.1.

# ambiguity about text encodings.

# signal to the remote server that it is aiming to speak HTTP/2, and to prevent
# a remote HTTP/1.1 server from expecting a 'proper' HTTP/1.1 request.
