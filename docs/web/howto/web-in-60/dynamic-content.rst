Generating a Page Dynamically
=============================





The goal of this example is to show you how to dynamically generate the
contents of a page.




Taking care of some of the necessary imports first, we'll import :api:`twisted.web.server.Site <Site>`, the :api:`twisted.internet.reactor <reactor>`, and :api:`twisted.internet.endpoints <endpoints>` :





.. code-block:: python


    from twisted.internet import reactor, endpoints
    from twisted.web.server import Site




The Site is a factory which associates a listening port with the HTTP
protocol implementation. The reactor is the main loop that drives any Twisted
application. Endpoints are used to create listening ports.




Next, we'll import one more thing from Twisted
Web: :api:`twisted.web.resource.Resource <Resource>` . An
instance of ``Resource`` (or a subclass) represents a page
(technically, the entity addressed by a URI).





.. code-block:: python


    from twisted.web.resource import Resource




Since we're going to make the demo resource a clock, we'll also import the
time module:





.. code-block:: python


    import time




With imports taken care of, the next step is to define
a ``Resource`` subclass which has the dynamic rendering
behavior we want. Here's a resource which generates a page giving the
time:





.. code-block:: python


    class ClockPage(Resource):
        isLeaf = True
        def render_GET(self, request):
            return "<html><body>%s</body></html>" % (time.ctime(),)




Setting ``isLeaf`` to ``True`` indicates
that ``ClockPage`` resources will never have any
children.




The ``render_GET`` method here will be called whenever the URI we
hook this resource up to is requested with the ``GET`` method. The byte
string it returns is what will be sent to the browser.




With the resource defined, we can create a ``Site`` from it:





.. code-block:: python


    resource = ClockPage()
    factory = Site(resource)




Just as with the previous static content example, this
configuration puts our resource at the very top of the URI hierarchy,
ie at ``/`` . With that ``Site`` instance, we can
tell the reactor to :doc:`create a TCP server <../../../core/howto/servers>` and start servicing requests:





.. code-block:: python


    endpoint = endpoints.TCP4ServerEndpoint(reactor, 8880)
    endpoint.listen(factory)
    reactor.run()




Here's the code with no interruptions:





.. code-block:: python


    from twisted.internet import reactor, endpoints
    from twisted.web.server import Site
    from twisted.web.resource import Resource
    import time

    class ClockPage(Resource):
        isLeaf = True
        def render_GET(self, request):
            return "<html><body>%s</body></html>" % (time.ctime(),)

    resource = ClockPage()
    factory = Site(resource)
    endpoint = endpoints.TCP4ServerEndpoint(reactor, 8880)
    endpoint.listen(factory)
    reactor.run()
