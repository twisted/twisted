  # Tox has an internal mapping of where to find python.exe.  Unfortunately,

  # to install separate python.exe in different directories for 32-bit and 64-bit.
  # We write out a .bat file which invokes the correct python.exe.  tox will invoke
  # this .at file.  This issue becomes important because linking to python.lib
