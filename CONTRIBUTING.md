As an open source project, Twisted welcomes contributions of many forms.
This document summarizes the process.

Twisted has a [Code of Conduct](./code_of_conduct.md).

For a PR to be accepted:

* It must have an associated GitHub issue ([file one here](https://github.com/twisted/twisted/issues/new/choose))
* All automated checks must pass
* The changeset must have 100% patch test coverage
