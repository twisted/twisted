# This file dictates what goes into a sdist tarball.
# As a release tarball, we want to include:
#  - All of the library code.
#  - All the useful documentation (but not the super historic stuff)
#  - All of the test files, so that the tests can be run on an installed copy.
# We do not want to include:
#  - Release management files (e.g. topfiles)
#  - Things only useful when running from a source checkout (_preamble.py)

# Do not include the old topfiles, or news fragments
