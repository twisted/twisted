<h1>Historical Documents</h1>

<p>Here are documents which contain no pertinent information or documentation.
People from the Twisted team have published them, and they serve as interesting
land marks and thoughts. Please don't look here for documentation -- however,
if you are interested in the history of Twisted, or want to quote from these
documents, feel free. Remember, however -- the documents here may contain
wrong information -- they are not updated as Twisted is, to keep their
historical value intact.</p>

  <dt><a href="2003/pycon/deferex.html"><cite>Generalization of Deferred Execution in Python</cite></a></dt>
  
  <dd><p>A deceptively simple architectural challenge faced by many
    multi-tasking applications is gracefully doing nothing.  Systems that
    must wait for the results of a long-running process, network message, or
    database query while continuing to perform other tasks must establish
    conventions for the semantics of waiting.  The simplest of these is
    blocking in a thread, but it has significant scalability problems.  In
    asynchronous frameworks, the most common approach is for long-running
    methods to accept a callback that will be executed when the command
    completes.  These callbacks will have different signatures depending on
    the nature of the data being requested, and often, a great deal of code
    is necessary to glue one portion of an asynchronous networking system to
    another.  Matters become even more complicated when a developer wants to
    wait for two different events to complete, requiring the developer to
    &quot;juggle&quot; the callbacks and create a third, mutually incompatible
    callback type to handle the final result.</p>
    
    <p>This paper describes the mechanism used by the Twisted framework for
    waiting for the results of long-running operations.  This mechanism,
    the <code>Deferred</code>, handles the often-neglected problems of
    error handling, callback juggling, inter-system communication and code
    readability.</p></dd>

  <dt><a href="2003/pycon/applications/applications.html"><cite>Applications of the Twisted Framework</cite></a></dt>

    <dd><p>Two projects developed using the Twisted framework are described;
    one, Twisted.names, which is included as part of the Twisted
    distribution, a domain name server and client API, and one, Pynfo, which
    is packaged separately, a network information robot.</p></dd>

    <dt><a href="2003/pycon/conch/conch.html"><cite>Twisted.Conch&#58; SSH in Python with Twisted</cite></a></dt>

    <dd><p>Conch is an implementation of the Secure Shell Protocol (currently
    in the IETF standarization process). Secure Shell (or SSH) is a popular
    protocol for remote shell access, file management and port forwarding
    protected by military-grade security. SSH supports multiple encryption and
    compression protocols for the wire transports, and a flexible system of
    multiplexed channels on top. Conch uses the Twisted networking framework
    to supply a library which can be used to implement both SSH clients and
    servers. In addition, it also contains several ready made client programs,
    including a drop-in replacement for the OpenSSH program from the OpenBSD
    project.</p></dd>

    <dt><a href="2003/pycon/lore/lore.html"><cite>The Lore Document Generation Framework</cite></a></dt>

    <dd><p>Lore is a documentation generation system which uses a limited
    subset of XHTML, together with some class attributes, as its source
    format. This allows for lower barrier of entry than many other similar
    systems, since HTML authoring tools are plentiful as is knowledge of
    HTML writing. As an added advantage, the source format is viewable
    directly, so that even if Lore is not available the documentation is
    useful. It currently outputs LaTeX and HTML, which allows for most
    use-cases.</p></dd>

    <dt><a href="2003/pycon/pb/pb.html"><cite>Perspective Broker: <q>Translucent</q> Remote Method calls in Twisted</cite></a></dt>

    <dd><p>One of the core services provided by the Twisted networking
    framework is <q>Perspective Broker</q>, which provides a clean, secure,
    easy-to-use Remote Procedure Call (RPC) mechanism. This paper explains the
    novel features of PB, describes the security model and its implementation,
    and provides brief examples of usage.</p></dd>

    <dt><a href="2003/pycon/releasing/releasing.html"><cite>Managing the Release of a Large Python Project</cite></a></dt>

    <dd><p>Twisted is a Python networking framework. At last count, the
    project contains nearly 60,000 lines of effective code (not comments or
    blank lines). When preparing a release, many details must be checked, and
    many steps must be followed. We describe here the technologies and tools
    we use, and explain how we built tools on top of them which help us make
    releasing as painless as possible.</p></dd>

    <dt><a href="2003/pycon/twisted-reality/twisted-reality.html"><cite>Twisted Reality: A Flexible Framework for Virtual Worlds</cite></a></dt>

    <dd><p>Flexibly modelling virtual worlds in object-oriented languages has
      historically been difficult; the issues arising from multiple
      inheritance and order-of-execution resolution have limited the
      sophistication of existing object-oriented simulations. Twisted
      Reality avoids these problems by reifying both actions and
      relationships, and avoiding inheritance in favor of automated
      composition through adapters and interfaces.</p></dd>
