Washort says, "Oh, did i ever tell you about the Java assignment i had at the beginning of the semester?"
Washort says, "I was bored so i did it without any loops or temp variables."

<Acapnotic> Texas does not come in eight ounce plastic containers with tinfoil lids.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no "fruit on the bottom" version of Texas.  Texas is not available in the dairy section of your grocer.  Texas does not help fufill your daily dietary requirement of calcium.

<disappearedng> since twisted has wsgi handler I thought it might be possible that I attach engine to reactor and then in my django code call reactor.engine.foo ..
