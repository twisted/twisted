<h1>Overview of Twisted IM</h1>

		<p>Twisted IM (Instance Messenger) is a multi-protocol chat
		framework, based on the Twisted framework we've all come to know
		and love. It's fairly simple and extensible in two directions -
		it's pretty easy to add new protocols, and it's also quite easy
		to add new front-ends.</p>

		<h2>Code flow</h2>

		<h3>AccountManager</h3>
		<p>The control flow starts at the relevant subclass of <code
			class="API"
			base="twisted.words.im">baseaccount.AccountManager</code>.
		The AccountManager is responsible for, well, managing accounts
		- remembering what accounts are available, their
		settings, adding and removal of accounts, and making accounts
		log on at startup.</p>

		<p>This would be a good place to start your interface, load a
		list of accounts from disk and tell them to login. Most of the
		method names in <code class="API"
			base="twisted.words.im.baseaccount">AccountManager</code>
		are pretty self-explanatory, and your subclass can override
		whatever it wants, but you <em>need</em> to override <code
			class="python">__init__</code>. Something like
		this:</p>

		<pre class="python">
def __init__(self):
	self.chatui = ... # Your subclass of basechat.ChatUI
	self.accounts = ... # Load account list
	for a in self.accounts:
		a.logOn(self.chatui)
		</pre>
		
		<h3>ChatUI</h3>
		<p>Account objects talk to the user via a subclass of <code
			class="API" base="twisted.words.im">basechat.ChatUI</code>.
		This class keeps track of all the various conversations that
		are currently active, so that when an account receives and
		incoming message, it can put that message in its correct
		context.</p>

		<p>How much of this class you need to override depends on what
		you need to do. You will need to override
		<code>getConversation</code> (a one-on-one conversation, like
		an IRC DCC chat) and <code>getGroupConversation</code> (a
		multiple user conversation, like an IRC channel). You might
		want to override <code>getGroup</code> and
		<code>getPerson</code>.</p>

		<p>The main problem with the default versions of the above
		routines is that they take a parameter, <code>Class</code>,
		which defaults to an abstract implementation of that class -
		for example, <code>getConversation</code> has a
		<code>Class</code> parameter that defaults to <code
			class="API"
			base="twisted.words.im">basechat.Conversation</code> which
		raises a lot of <code>NotImplementedError</code>s. In your
		subclass, override the method with a new method whose Class
		parameter defaults to your own implementation of
		<code>Conversation</code>, that simply calls the parent
		class' implementation.</p>

		<h3>Conversation and GroupConversation</h3>
		<p>These classes are where your interface meets the chat
		protocol. Chat protocols get a message, find the appropriate
		<code>Conversation</code> or <code>GroupConversation</code>
		object, and call its methods when various interesting things
		happen.</p>

		<p>Override whatever methods you want to get the information
		you want to display. You must override the <code>hide</code>
		and <code>show</code> methods, however - they are called
		frequently and the default implementation raises
		<code>NotImplementedError</code>.</p>

		<h3>Accounts</h3>
		<p>An account is an instance of a subclass of <code
			class="API"
			base="twisted.words.im">basesupport.AbstractAccount</code>.
		For more details and sample code, see the various
		<code>*support</code> files in <code>twisted.words.im</code>.</p>
