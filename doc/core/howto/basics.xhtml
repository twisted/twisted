<h1>The Basics</h1>

<h2>Application</h2>

<p>Twisted programs usually work with
<code class="API">twisted.application.service.Application</code>.
This class usually holds all persistent configuration of
a running server -- ports to bind to, places where connections
to must be kept or attempted, periodic actions to do and almost
everything else. It is the root object in a tree of services implementing
<code class="API" base="twisted.application.service">IService</code>.</p>

<p>Other HOWTOs describe how to write custom code for Applications,
but this one describes how to use already written code (which can be
part of Twisted or from a third-party Twisted plugin developer).  The
Twisted distribution comes with an important tool to deal with
Applications, <code>twistd</code>.</p>

<p><code>Application</code>s are just Python objects, which can
be created and manipulated in the same ways as any other object.
</p>

<h2>twistd</h2><a name="twistd" />

<p>The Twisted Daemon is a program that knows how to run Applications.
This program
is <code class="shell">twistd(1)</code>.  Strictly
speaking, <code class="shell">twistd</code> is not necessary --
fetching the application, getting the <code>IService</code> component,
calling <code>startService</code>, scheduling <code>stopService</code> when
the reactor shuts down, and then calling <code>reactor.run()</code> could be
done manually. <code class="shell">twistd(1)</code>, however, supplies 
many options which are highly useful for program set up.</p>

<p><code class="shell">twistd</code> supports choosing a reactor (for more on
reactors, see <a href="choosing-reactor.xhtml">Choosing a Reactor</a>), logging
to a logfile, daemonizing and more. <code class="shell">twistd</code> supports all
Applications mentioned above -- and an additional one. Sometimes
it is convenient to write the code for building a class in straight
Python. One big source of such Python files is the <code>doc/examples</code>
directory. When a straight Python file which defines an <code>Application</code>
object called <code>application</code> is used, use the <code class="shell">-y</code>
option.</p>

<p>When <code class="shell">twistd</code> runs, it records its process id in a
<code>twistd.pid</code> file (this can be configured via a command line
switch). In order to shutdown the <code class="shell">twistd</code> process, kill that
pid (usually you would do <code class="shell">kill `cat twistd.pid`</code>).
</p>

<p>As always, the gory details are in the manual page.</p>

<h2>OS Integration</h2>

<p>
If you have an Application that runs with <code class="shell">twistd</code>,
you can easily deploy it on RedHat Linux or Debian GNU/Linux based systems
using the <code class="shell">tap2deb</code> or <code
class="shell">tap2rpm</code> tools. These take a Twisted Application file (of
any of the supported formats — Python source, XML or pickle), and build a
Debian or RPM package (respectively) that installs the Application as a system
service. The package includes the Application file, a default
<code>/etc/init.d/</code> script that starts and stops the process with twistd,
and post-installation scripts that configure the Application to be run in the
appropriate init levels.
</p>

<!-- Is "note" really the right class to be using here? -->
<div class="note">
<code class="shell">tap2rpm</code> and <code class="shell">tap2deb</code> do
not package your entire application and dependent code, just the Twisted
Application file. You will need to find some other way to package your Python
code, such as <code class="API">distutils</code>' <code>bdist_rpm</code>
command.
</div>

<p>
For more savvy users, these tools also generate the source package, allowing
you to modify and polish things which automated software cannot detect (such as
dependencies or relationships to virtual packages).
