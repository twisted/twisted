    <h1>Using Threads in Twisted</h1>

    <h2>Running code in a thread-safe manner</h2>

    <p>Most code in Twisted is not thread-safe. For example,
    writing data to a transport from a protocol is not thread-safe.
    Therefore, we want a way to schedule methods to be run in the
    main event loop. This can be done using the function <code
    class="API">twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorThreads.callFromThread</code>:</p>
<pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import reactor

def notThreadSafe(x):
     """do something that isn't thread-safe"""
     # ...

def threadSafeScheduler():
    """Run in thread-safe manner."""
    reactor.callFromThread(notThreadSafe, 3) # will run 'notThreadSafe(3)'
                                             # in the event loop
reactor.run()
</pre>

    <h2>Running code in threads</h2>

    <p>Sometimes we may want to run methods in threads - for
    example, in order to access blocking APIs. Twisted provides
    methods for doing so using the IReactorThreads API (<code
    class="API">twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorThreads</code>).
    Additional utility functions are provided in <code
    class="API">twisted.internet.threads</code>. Basically, these
    methods allow us to queue methods to be run by a thread
    pool.</p>

    <p>For example, to run a method in a thread we can do:</p>
<pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import reactor

def aSillyBlockingMethod(x):
    import time
    time.sleep(2)
    print x

# run method in thread
reactor.callInThread(aSillyBlockingMethod, "2 seconds have passed")
reactor.run()
</pre>

    <h2>Utility Methods</h2>

    <p>The utility methods are not part of the <code
    class="API">twisted.internet.reactor</code> APIs, but are implemented
    in <code class="API">twisted.internet.threads</code>.</p>

    <p>If we have multiple methods to run sequentially within a thread,
    we can do:</p>

<pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import reactor, threads

def aSillyBlockingMethodOne(x):
    import time
    time.sleep(2)
    print x

def aSillyBlockingMethodTwo(x):
    print x

# run both methods sequentially in a thread
commands = [(aSillyBlockingMethodOne, ["Calling First"], {})]
commands.append((aSillyBlockingMethodTwo, ["And the second"], {}))
threads.callMultipleInThread(commands)
reactor.run()
</pre>

    <p>For functions whose results we wish to get, we can have the
    result returned as a Deferred:</p>
<pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import reactor, threads

def doLongCalculation():
    # .... do long calculation here ...
    return 3

def printResult(x):
    print x

# run method in thread and get result as defer.Deferred
d = threads.deferToThread(doLongCalculation)
d.addCallback(printResult)
reactor.run()
</pre>

    <p>If you wish to call a method in the reactor thread and get its result,
    you can use <code class="API"
    base="twisted.internet.threads">blockingCallFromThread</code>:</p>

<pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import threads, reactor, defer
from twisted.web.client import getPage
from twisted.web.error import Error

def inThread():
    try:
        result = threads.blockingCallFromThread(
            reactor, getPage, "http://twistedmatrix.com/")
    except Error, exc:
        print exc
    else:
        print result
    reactor.callFromThread(reactor.stop)

reactor.callInThread(inThread)
reactor.run()
</pre>

    <p><code>blockingCallFromThread</code> will return the object or raise
    the exception returned or raised by the function passed to it. If the
    function passed to it returns a Deferred, it will return the value the
    Deferred is called back with or raise the exception it is errbacked
    with.</p>

    <h2>Managing the Thread Pool</h2>

    <p>The thread pool is implemented by <code
    class="API">twisted.python.threadpool.ThreadPool</code>.</p>

    <p>We may want to modify the size of the threadpool, increasing
    or decreasing the number of threads in use.  We can do this
    do this quite easily:</p>

<pre class="python">
from twisted.internet import reactor

reactor.suggestThreadPoolSize(30)
</pre>

  <p>The default size of the thread pool depends on the reactor being used;
  the default reactor uses a minimum size of 5 and a maximum size of 10.  Be
  careful that you understand threads and their resource usage before
  drastically altering the thread pool sizes.</p>
