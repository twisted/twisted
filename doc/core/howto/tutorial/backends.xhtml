<h1>The Evolution of Finger: pluggable backends</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> This is the fifth part of the Twisted tutorial <a
href="index.xhtml">Twisted from Scratch, or The Evolution of Finger</a>.</p>

<p>In this part we will add new several new backends to our finger service using
the component-based architecture developed in <a href="components.xhtml">The
Evolution of Finger: moving to a component based architecture</a>. This will
show just how convenient it is to implement new back-ends when we move to a
component based architecture. Note that here we also use an interface we
previously wrote, <code>FingerSetterFactory</code>, by supporting one single
method. We manage to preserve the service's ignorance of the network.</p>

<h2>Another Back-end</h2>

<a href="listings/finger/finger19b_changes.py" class="py-listing">finger19b_changes.py</a>
<p>
Full source code here: <a class="py-listing" href="listings/finger/finger19b.tac">finger19b.tac</a>
</p>

<p>We've already written this, but now we get more for less work:
the network code is completely separate from the back-end.</p>


<h2>Yet Another Back-end: Doing the Standard Thing</h2>

<a href="listings/finger/finger19c_changes.py" class="py-listing">finger19c_changes.py</a>
<p>
Full source code here: <a class="py-listing" href="listings/finger/finger19c.tac">finger19c.tac</a>
</p>

<p>Not much to say except that now we can be churn out backends like crazy. Feel
like doing a back-end for <a href="http://www.advogato.org/">Advogato</a>, for
example? Dig out the XML-RPC client support Twisted has, and get to work!</p>
