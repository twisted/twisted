<h1>The Evolution of Finger: using a single factory for
    multiple protocols</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> This is the eighth part of the Twisted tutorial <a
href="index.xhtml">Twisted from Scratch, or The Evolution of Finger</a>.</p>

<p>In this part, we add HTTPS support to our web frontend, showing how to have a
single factory listen on multiple ports. More information on using SSL in
Twisted can be found in the <a href="../ssl.xhtml">SSL howto</a>.</p>

<h2>Support HTTPS</h2>

<p>All we need to do to code an HTTPS site is just write a context factory (in
this case, which loads the certificate from a certain file) and then use the
twisted.application.internet.SSLServer method. Note that one factory (in this
case, a site) can listen on multiple ports with multiple protocols.</p>
