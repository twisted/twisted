<h1>Twisted Mail Tutorial: Building an IMAP Server</h1>

<p>twisted.protocols.imap4.IMAP4Server is written so that, in 
most cases, it need not be subclassed.  The preferred way to 
implement a server is to implement the interfaces IMAP4Server 
depends on.</p>

<p>The two required interfaces are IAccount and IMailbox, 
both of which are defined in twisted.protocols.imap4. There 
are several other optional interfaces as well. Ideally, 
accounts and mailboxes are hooked up to an IMAP4Server 
protocol instance via twisted.cred.</p>

<p>Here is a brief example:</p>

<pre>
from twisted.cred import portal
from twisted.protocols import imap4

class Account:
    __implements__ = (imap4.IAccount,)

    # Actually implement the interface here

def logout():
    # Cleanup logic goes here

class Realm:
    __implements__ = (portal.IRealm,)

    def requestAvatar(self, avatarID, mind, *interfaces):
        if imap4.IAccount not in interfaces:
            raise NotImplementedError
        return imap4.IAccount, Account(avatarID), logout

    p = portal.Portal(Realm())

    # Contrive to have your ServerFactory's buildProtocol
    # set the "portal" attribute of the IMAP4Server instance
    # it creates to the `p' defined above.
</pre>

<p>For more information, refer to the cred and component 
howtos available on the Twisted website.</p>
