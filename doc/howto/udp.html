    <h1>UDP Networking</h1>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>Unlike TCP, UDP has no notion of connections. A UDP socket can receive
    datagrams from any server on the network, and send datagrams to any host
    on the network. In addition, datagrams may arrive in any order, never
    arrive at all, or be duplicated in transit.</p>

    <p>Since there are no multiple connections, we only use a single object,
    a protocol, for each UDP socket. We then use the reactor to connect
    this protocol to a UDP transport, using the 
    <code class="API">twisted.internet.interfaces.IReactorUDP</code>
    reactor API.</p>
    
    <h2>DatagramProtocol</h2>

    <p>At the base, the place where you actually implement the protocol parsing
    and handling, is the DatagramProtocol class. This class will usually be decended
    from <code class="API">twisted.internet.protocol.DatagramProtocol</code>. Most
    protocol handlers inherit either from this class or from one of its
    convenience children. The DatagramProtocol class receives datagrams, and can
    send them out over the network. Received datagrams include the address they
    were sent from, and when sending datagrams the address to send to must
    be specified.</p>
    
    <p>Here is a simple example:</p>
    <pre class="python">
from twisted.internet.protocol import DatagramProtocol
from twisted.internet import reactor

class Echo(Protocol):
    
    def datagramReceived(self, data, (host, port)):
        print "received %r from %s:%d" % (data, host, port)
        self.transport.write(data, (host, port))

reactor.listenUDP(9999, Echo())
reactor.start()
    </pre>
    
    <p>As you can see, the protocol is registed with the reactor.
    This means it may be persisted if it's added to an application,
    and thus it has
    <code class="API">twisted.internet.protocol.DatagramProtocol.startProtocol</code> and 
    <code class="API">twisted.internet.protocol.DatagramProtocol.stopProtocol</code> methods that
    will get called when the protocol is connected and disconnected
    from a UDP socket.</p>


    <h2>Connected UDP</h2>

    <p>A connected UDP socket is slighly different from a standard one - it can
    only send and receive datagramss to/from a single address, but this does
    not in any way imply a connection. Datagrams may still arrive in any order,
    and the port on the other side may have no one listening. The benefit
    of the connected UDP socket is that it is faster.</p>

    <p>Unlike a regular UDP protocol, we do not need to specify where to
    send datagrams to, and are not told where they came from since
    they can only come from address the socket is 'connected' to.</p>

    <pre class="python">
from twisted.internet.protocol import ConnectedDatagramProtocol
from twisted.internet import reactor

class Echo(ConnectedDatagramProtocol):
    
    def datagramReceived(self, data):
        self.transport.write(data)

reactor.connectUDP("www.example.com", 9999, Echo())
reactor.start()
    </pre>
